# SEO Strategy: Keywords & Best Practices

This document outlines the keywords I have already coded into your website and the *Non-Technical* actions you must take to maintain your ranking.

## 1. The Keywords (Included in Code)
I have already hard-coded these into your website's `metadata` and `JSON-LD` (Structured Data). You do **not** need to do anything extra for these; the code handles them.

### Primary Brand Keywords
*   **Lumora Triad** (Official Name)
*   **Lumora** (Short Name - *Added as 'Alternate Name'*)
*   **Lumora Tech** (Variation)
*   **Lumora Triad Agency** (Variation)

### Service Keywords
*   **Web Development**
*   **UI/UX Design**
*   **Branding**
*   **Digital Agency**
*   **Software Development**
*   **Website Design India**

## 2. "Things to Follow" (Your Responsibility)
Google ranks websites based on **Trust** and **Activity**. Since your code is perfect, your next job is to build trust.

### A. The "Consistency" Rule (NAP)
**Rule:** Your Name, Address, and Phone Number (NAP) must be IDENTICAL everywhere.
*   **Don't use:** "Lumora Triad" on Instagram but "Lumora Technologies" on LinkedIn.
*   **Do use:** "Lumora Triad" everywhere.
*   **Why:** If Google sees different names, it gets confused and lowers your rank.

### B. The "Backlink" Strategy (Most Important)
A "Backlink" is when another website clicks to yours. This is how you climb to #1.
*   **Action:** Ask 3 friends to post on their Blog, LinkedIn, or Twitter:
    > "Check out this amazing agency **Lumora Triad** for web development: https://www.lumoratriad.in"
*   **Note:** The text they click (Anchor Text) matters. Ask them to link the words "Web Development" or "Lumora Triad".

### C. The Content Strategy
You don't need a blog, but you need to refresh your content occasionally.
*   **Update your "Projects" or "Case Studies" every month.**
*   Google loves "Freshness." If you never change your site, Google thinks you are out of business.

### D. Social Proof
Google reads social media.
*   Ensure your **Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter** bios all contain your website link: `https://www.lumoratriad.in`.
*   Post once a week on LinkedIn about your work.
